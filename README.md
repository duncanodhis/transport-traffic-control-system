# Transport Control System README

Welcome to the Transport Control System project! This project uses AI-based solutions to implement a comprehensive system that controls transportation using computer vision, image object detection, and smart routing. The frontend is developed in Flutter, while the backend, including AI components, uses Python. The system is built and tested using GitHub Actions.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a transport control system that leverages AI technologies to optimize vehicle routing and monitor traffic conditions using computer vision and image object detection. The system helps improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance safety on roads.

## System Architecture
The transport control system has three main components:

1. **Frontend**: A Flutter-based mobile application that provides the user interface for drivers and administrators to interact with the system.
2. **Backend**: A Python-based backend that handles data processing, communication with the frontend, and AI-based decision-making.
3. **AI Components**: Includes computer vision models for object detection and routing algorithms for smart navigation.

## Frontend
The frontend is built using Flutter, offering a cross-platform solution for mobile devices. It provides the following functionalities:

- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Route planning and navigation
- Alerts for traffic conditions and incidents

## Backend
The backend is developed in Python and connects with the frontend via RESTful APIs. It is responsible for:

- Data processing and storage
- Communication with AI models
- Handling user requests and responses

## AI Components
The AI components are at the core of the transport control system, providing the following features:

- **Computer Vision**: Uses image object detection to analyze traffic conditions, detect vehicles, and identify traffic incidents.
- **Smart Routing**: Implements AI-based algorithms to calculate optimal routes based on real-time traffic data.

## GitHub Actions
We use GitHub Actions for automated builds, testing, and deployment. The GitHub Actions workflow includes:

- **Build**: Compiles the Flutter frontend and the Python backend.
- **Test**: Runs unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
- **Deploy**: Deploys the latest build to the testing and production environments.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
